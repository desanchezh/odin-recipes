    <h3>Directions</h3>
    Marinate Steak
    <ol>
        <li>Place sliced or cubed steak in a bowl and toss with the soy sauce, ground cumin, oregano and vinegar</li>
        <li>Allow to sit a few minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    Prepare Sauce
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together the soy sauce, vinegar and corn starch if using and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    Stir Fry Steak & Veggies
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan, large skillet or a wok, over medium-high to high heat. Add the steak, and cook stir frying until browned and seared, 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pan onto plate and set aside. Do not overcrowd pan. You may have to do this in batches with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red onion and cook for about 2-5 minutes, until softened and then remove from pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil and add the green onions and sauté 20-30 seconds then add the tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 2-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are still intact.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to pan and stir to combine, let cook for approx 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return the steak and accumulated juices, and the onions to the pan and sprinkle over the cilantro. Toss gently to coat everything in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with rice and fries. Some recipes call for stirring the fries into the sauce as well - feel free to do this or serve fries on the side with the rice as well.</li>
    </ol>
